    "In this exercise, we are going to examine two applications of the basis shift tools that were discussed in class (SVD and FFT) in digital image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the issues we are investigating is image compression. For this purpose, in general, the information inside the image can be considered as a data matrix, then, in a way, suitable bases for this information matrix are found. The primary image is displayed with less information by depicting the primary matrix on a more important basis and keeping the necessary information. Data and compression in practice. For the sake of simplicity, the images we are considering in this exercise are considered black and white. Still, the methods under consideration can be implemented simply and by changing the shape of the tensors of multi-channel (color) images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of SVD, we can find bases for the column space of the matrix of our desired image on which the columns of our image have the highest correlation. From the point of view of these bases in the descending order of the size of the singular values, they will contain the most general information of the columns of the image, so by keeping only $r$ initial columns of the found bases ($U$) along with the combined vectors ($V^T$) and singular values ($\\Sigma$) corresponding to them, we can keep a good approximation of the general image. From the expert point of view, the reconstruction that has been done is actually a kind of reconstruction of the primary matrix in the lower order (rank approximation) that you were familiar with before. The amount of\n",
    "\n",
    "In this view, $r$ is the control valve for the amount of compression we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of FFT and Fourier transform, we can also consider the information in the rows and columns of our image matrix as two-dimensional discrete signal values and image it in the space of two-dimensional fundamental and periodic wave bases. It can be shown that the larger size of the image vector in the direction of a certain wave means the greater importance of that wave in the formation of patterns in the image ([Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parseval%27s_identity)), so keeping $r$ of the basic wave in which the size of the image vector is the largest in their direction can be used to reconstruct the image information. For image compression, a good approximation should be used. In this view, the $r$ value of the control valve will be the compression rate we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that we can explore with a similar idea of applying the described base transform is image denoising. In the condition that the noise in the image is uniform and in such a way that it does not distort the general information in the image, from the point of view of SVD, according to the examination of the general information, the direction of the image vector based on bases with more singular values has not changed much, and the information related to the vectors having less importance can remove noise and keep the original information of the image. From the point of view of FFT, considering that the noise pattern is generally modeled with high-frequency waves, keeping the constitutive waves containing the lower frequency in the image can separate the image information from the noise (this is called low-pass filtering)."
